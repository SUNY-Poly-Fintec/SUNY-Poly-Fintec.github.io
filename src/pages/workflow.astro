<h1>AI Server Workflow</h1>
<p class="card">Data come from a broker/exchange into a compute node which performs ETL/cleaning and feature engineering. Cleaned data feed a CUDA GPU machine for AI workloads. The compute node also calls the OpenAI API for LLM tasks (summaries, embeddings, tool calls). Results feed storage and dashboards.</p>
